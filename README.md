Hi! I am a german PhD student in biotechnology improving my Python knowledge on GitHub to use it for data analysis of my experiments in the lab. I would like to contribute to bioinformatics projects related to RNA-sequencing or ribosome profiling in special. Learning by doing is always the best way!
